## Web scraping and analysis

In this project, I will use a package called `BeautifulSoup` to collect the data from the web. Once the data is collected it will be saved into a local `.csv` file in order to start analysis.

### Scraping data from Skytrax

If you visit [https://www.airlinequality.com] you can see that there is a lot of data there. For this project, will only be interested in reviews related to British Airways and the Airline itself.

If navigated to this link: [https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways] the data will display. `Python` and `BeautifulSoup` will be made use of to collect all the links to the reviews and then to collect the text data on each of the individual review links.
